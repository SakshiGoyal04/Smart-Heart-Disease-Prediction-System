# Smart-Heart-Disease-Prediction-System
Smart Heart Disease risk prediction system predicts whether there is a risk of the presence of this disease in an individual or not. Supervised learning technique is used in this system to make a prediction about the disease. The target variable for analysis is “target”.  The value 0 represents that there is no presence of the heart disease risk and 1 represents that there is a presence. Supervised learning techniques like logistic regression, decision tree, SVM, Neural network and some others are used for data modelling purpose.
